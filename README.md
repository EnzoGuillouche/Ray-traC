# Ray-traC

I got insomnia again, so i decided to explore something I really wanted to dive into, ray-tracing. And of course, i'm gonna do it in C.

The program generates 2 (can generate more, haven't tested though) entites, with at least 1 as a light source.
The program will compute every mathematical nightmare embedded in itself to simulate graphically light and shadow (basic ray-tracing).
